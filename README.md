### Repository for Named Entity Recognition project for Natural Language Processing course @ FRI.

Link to the dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwjQe5-VEaFRXwt6E2A1B5GCF8BDdjXX?usp=sharing.

There are three files on drive. `ner_csv.` is the original dataset. `ner_first_preprocessing.csv` is the file with removed duplicates and NaNs. `sentense_dict.json` is the dictionary with sentences (there is an example in `initial_dataset_analysis.ipynb`). For each sentence we keep the words and lemmas with their corresponding POS and NE tags.
